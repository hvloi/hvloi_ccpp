WHY THERE IS A HEADER FILE IN A SOURCE DIRECTORY (*.C) ? ? ?

There are some reasons to do this, but I want to show you a main one.

1. Usual Headers - A Dirty Introduction About Normal Header Files.

- Header files are usually placed in "header" or "include" directory.
These header files usually contain definitions of functions that are used widely
in souce code, in many different souce files.
- These header files can also be the API interface of a library, user just
follow the definition of funtions and use them and do not know about their
implementations.

2. Back To Our Question.

- The main reason to put a header file(s) in souce (*.C) directory is, sometime,
we want to seperate our code to functions and classify these functions to
approriate categories. BUT, we ONLY want these functions are visible locally
inside a directory.
- An applicable way to reach the expectation is separating the classified
functions to source files (*.C) and provide the definitions of these functions
in header files, usually these header files should place in the same directory
with souce files (*.C), then we can "include" these header files in source files
in the same directory. By this way we can hide the definitions of functions that
we do not want them to be visible to other place.
=> That's all.
